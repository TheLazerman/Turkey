# The Turkey Recipe
## Steps
1. Aquire Turkey
	1. Rule of thumb - 1lb ~1.25lb of turkey per adult
	2. The bigger the turkey, the longer it will take to thaw.
2. Thaw Turkey 
	1. Unwrap Turkey and dab dry with a towel
	2. Place Turkey in a roasting pan and cover with tinfoil
	3. Allow to thaw in the fridge as long as possible. 
3. Prep Turkey
	1. 3 Days prior to cooking, take Turkey out of the fridge.
	2. Dab dry with a towel, remove any ice/water from the roasting pan. 
	3. Make the brine (Recipe Below)
	4. Cover entire Turkey with the brine. 
		1. Make a cut in the skin at the bottom of the breast, use your hand to separate the skin from the breast meat.
		2. Cover as much of the meat directly as you can with the brine. 
	3. Stuff the Turkey with slices of onion, lemon, apple and any remaining aromatics. 
	5. Return the Turkey to the fridge until it's time to cook!
4. Cook Turkey (~4-5 hours)
	1. Pre-heat the oven to 400
	2. Place the Turkey on the bottom rack, un-covered for ~1 Hour or until the skin is a golden brown. 
	3. Drop the oven to 350, cover the Turkey in aluminum foil and cook for ~3 hours. 
	4. Turkey is done when a thermometer inserted into the breast meat reads 165.
